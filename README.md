### My current duties

...

### Farewell words and recommendations

- Focus on education, in long run term get at leat Bachelor degree
    - But always do hands-on / practices (hobby project, hands-on/lab sites (see below))
    - Assess possibility to take remote Bachelor program (e.g., [this from Coursera/University of London](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london)), but make sure you can team up with someone, or check [SANS Technology Institute](https://www.sans.edu/)

- Learn English: 1. Read, 2.Listen, 3. Speak (incl. presentations), 4. Write (ChatGPT to the rescue)

- Learn how to search for information ("Google")

    - Consider some OSINT videos/courses: [Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) in 5 Hours by The Cyber Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwA6MmbeGNo) or [OSINT Introduction: What is Open Source Intelligence? by OSINT Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa5LbKqCmFI)

- Watch some (video) tutorials on fundamental subjects and try to understand and replicate each step:

    - Install Linux inside Virtual Box and configure web server with simplest "Hello World" index.html page

    - Configure PHP support for web serve and create "index.php" that will print "Hello World"

    - Create more Linux VMs and configure network between them

    - Create repository in Github, checkout it in your Linux VM (+ created changes, push them to Github...)

- Find a mentor / someone who inspires you to learn
    - Find a friend, agree on and define some (feasible) goals:

- Being a pupil/student gives a lot of discounts on many resources/platforms/certification: use it!

NB: When just starting with CTFs, make sure to attempt event after it is officially finished and write-ups (solutions) are available; Before sneaking into solution, try to solve it your self for ~30 minutes (don't allow it to become boring).
